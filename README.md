# nvim-lsp-config

Just a bunch of nvim lsp configurations in one place.
Basically my own lsp zero with lazy loading.

- Rellikeht/lazy-utils - used for lazy loading configurations
  with filetype autocommand
- mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls - to use jdtls setup
- p00f/clangd_extensions.nvim - for clangd setup
