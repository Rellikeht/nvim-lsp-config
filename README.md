# nvim-lsp-config

Just a bunch of nvim lsp configurations in one place.
Basically my own lsp zero with lazy loading.

# dependencies

- neovim/nvim-lspconfig - obvious one
- Rellikeht/lazy-utils - used for lazy loading configurations
  with filetype autocommand
- mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls - to use jdtls setup
